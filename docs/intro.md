# MEAN.io

MEAN is a framework for an easy starting point with [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) based applications. It is designed to give you a quick and organized way to start developing MEAN based web apps with useful modules like Mongoose and Passport pre-bundled and configured. We mainly try to take care of the connection points between existing popular frameworks and solve common integration problems.
## Prerequisites
* *MongoDB* - <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/downloads">Download</a> and Install mongodb - <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual">Checkout their manual</a> if you're just starting.
* *Node.js* - <a href="http://nodejs.org/download/">Download</a> and I×žstall Node.js, codeschool has free <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/real-time-web-with-node-js">node</a> and <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js">angular</a> tutorials.
* *Git* - Get git using a package manager or <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">download</a> it.
* Grunt - Download and Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com).
```
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```

## Staying up to date
After initializing a project, you'll see that the root directory of your project is already a git repository. MEAN uses git to download and update its own code. To handle its own operations, MEAN creates a remote called `upstream`. This way you can use git as you would in any other project.

To maintain your own public or private repository, add your repository as remote. See here for information on [adding an existing project to GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line).

```bash
git remote add origin <remote repository URL>
git push -u origin master
```
