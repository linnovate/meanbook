## MEAN Network
Mean is stand-alone instance that you can install locally or host on your server.  
We want to provide value to developers and are assembling a set of services which will be called the mean network.
We're building all of this as we speak but we allready have some elements in place.

### Network User management

#### Registration
```bash
mean register
```
#### Identity

### Deploy
Coming soon!
